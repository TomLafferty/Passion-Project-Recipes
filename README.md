Web based social recipe sharing app


## Passion Project: Family Recipes

This will be a web based recipe app where members can socially share family and personal recipes.

Users will have the ability to create login information, publish recipes, comment on published recipes, and like posts.  Will be able to view who likes which posts. Each user will have their own viewable page where their posts will be collected.

Now family will have a place to share Grandmom's old family recipes as well as new favorites!

Data will be collected and visualized based on popular ingredients and recipes.

Using python, Django, postgreSQL, matplotlib
